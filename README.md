# CORAL-Enhanced Lightweight 1D-CNN for Cross-Load Bearing Fault Detection on the CWRU Dataset

Rolling-element bearings are critical for the reliability of rotating assets, yet most data-driven fault diagnosis models fail when operating conditions change. This paper investigates cross-load domain shift on the Case Western Reserve University bearing dataset using a compact one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) combined with unsupervised domain adaptation. A rigorously grouped splitting strategy prevents information leakage across motor-load conditions, and three training schemes are compared: a supervised baseline, correlation alignment (CORAL), and Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN). For transfer from 0 hp to 1 hp, the supervised CNN attains only 39.2% accuracy, with complete loss of the normal class. CORAL and DANN do not improve overall accuracy (35.3% and 31.7%, respectively) but substantially reshape class-wise recalls, enhancing ball-fault detection while collapsing inner-race recognition. When the domain shift is simplified to a single defect size (0.007″), CORAL reaches 68.9% accuracy and perfect recall for ball and inner-race faults, at the expense of severe confusion between ball and outer-race faults. t-SNE visualizations show that global feature alignment preserves cluster structure but distorts class-conditional decision boundaries, leading to negative transfer. The study highlights that lightweight CNNs with global alignment are insufficient for robust cross-load deployment and motivates class-conditional and semi-supervised adaptation for industrial monitoring.
